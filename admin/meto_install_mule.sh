# Note: The way this script is intended to work is that you should first
# load whatever modules or setup you wish to do to ensure that when you
# run "python" at the command line (i.e. exactly the command "python")
# it accesses the version of Python which you are intended to create a
# Mule install for.  At the Met Office this would mean once for the
# system's own Python and then again to cover the various "scitools"
# versions (some of which might use the same copy of Python + Numpy)
#
# So for instance suppose you want to create a new install for the
# latest "default-current" scitools environment:
#
#    module load scitools/default-current
#    ./meto_install_mule.sh
#
# If, for example default-current currently is using Python 3.8 with
# Numpy 12.10 this will create a new directory called
#    python-3.8_numpy-12.10
#
# Which you should then tell the modulefiles to load when the user
# has the default-current environment loaded
#
# It is intended that this script is run from the directory containing
# the Mule installs in $UMDIR i.e. $UMDIR/mule/mule-YYYY.MM.V/ so that
# the above directories all appear there.  Since it uses the
# library-lock functionality of Mule's install script you *must* build
# Mule directly into the destination and not copy it there afterwards
